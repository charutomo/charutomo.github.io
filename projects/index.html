	<h3> - Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus(URECA) - MH9015 (Aug 2021 - Present)</h3>
	<p><i> "Security Evaluation of NTRU Public Key Cryptosystem"</i><p>
	<p>NTRU is a public key cryptosystem which allows two remote parties to communicate in a secure way without sharing a secret key. NTRU is expected to be secure against the future quantum computer. In this project, we will analyze the security of NTRU. We will try to improve the existing attacks on NTRU, or to develop new attacks against NTRU. This project covers Mathematics (more specifically, lattice), programming and algorithms.</p>

	<h3> - MLDA DLW Hackathon (15-17 Oct 2021)</h3>
	<p> 48-hour virtual Hackathon with my teammates (Jun Guang and Kieran) dedicated to hack with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI).  </p>
